Warning: Trying to implement RAM in registers. Block RAM or DRAM implementation is not possible for one or more of the following reasons :
	1: RAM has multiple writes via different ports in same process. If RAM inferencing intended, write to one port per process.

WARNING: [Synth 8-4767] Trying to implement RAM 'ram_reg' in registers. Block RAM or DRAM implementation is not possible; see log for reasons.
Reason is one or more of the following :
	1: RAM has multiple writes via different ports in same process. If RAM inferencing intended, write to one port per process. 
	2: Unable to determine number of words or word size in RAM. 
	3: No valid read/write found for RAM.
